 * You have a connected directed graph that has positive weights in the adjacency matrix g.
 * The graph is represented as a square matrix, where g[i][j] is the weight of the edge (i, j), or -1 if there is no such edge.

 Given g and the index of a start vertex s, find the minimal distances between the start vertex s and each of the vertices of the graph.

 Example

 For

 g = [[-1, 3, 2],
 [2, -1, 0],
 [-1, 0, -1]]
 and s = 0, the output should be
 graphDistances(g, s) = [0, 2, 2].

public class GraphDistances {

    int[] graphDistances(int[][] g, int s) {
        return new int[0];
    }

}
