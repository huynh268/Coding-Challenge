 * Given an encoded string, return its corresponding decoded string.

 The encoding rule is: k[encoded_string], where the encoded_string inside the square brackets is repeated exactly k times. Note: k is guaranteed to be a positive integer.

 Note that your solution should have linear complexity because this is what you will be asked during an interview.

 Example

 For s = "4[ab]", the output should be

 decodeString(s) = "abababab";

 For s = "2[b3[a]]", the output should be

 decodeString(s) = "baaabaaa";

 For s = "z1[y]zzz2[abc]", the output should be

 decodeString(s) = "zyzzzabcabc".
