 * You have two strings, s and t. The string t contains only unique elements. Find and return the minimum consecutive substring of s that contains all of the elements from t.

 It's guaranteed that the answer exists. If there are several answers, return the one which starts from the smallest index.

 Example

 For s = "adobecodebanc" and t = "abc", the output should be
 minSubstringWithAllChars(s, t) = "banc".

public class MinSubstringWithAllChars {
    String minSubstringWithAllChars(String s, String t) {

    }
}
