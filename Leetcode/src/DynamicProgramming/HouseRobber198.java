 *
 * You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed,
 * the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security system connected and
 * it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.

 Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each house, determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.
