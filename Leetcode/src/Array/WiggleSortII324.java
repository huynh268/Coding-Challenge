 *
 * Given an unsorted array nums, reorder it such that nums[0] < nums[1] > nums[2] < nums[3]....

 Example:
 (1) Given nums = [1, 5, 1, 1, 6, 4], one possible answer is [1, 4, 1, 5, 1, 6].
 (2) Given nums = [1, 3, 2, 2, 3, 1], one possible answer is [2, 3, 1, 3, 1, 2].

 Note:
 You may assume all input has valid answer.

 Follow Up:
 Can you do it in O(n) time and/or in-place with O(1) extra space?
